click on sheets to see the solutions.

challenge1 sheet has the excel workbook with solutions.

sheet1 has first pivot table that analyzes your initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category

sheet2 new sheet with a pivot table that analyzes your initial sheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, or canceled, or are currently live per sub-category.  Create a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent category based on the table that you created.

new sheet3 with a pivot table that has a column of outcome, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of outcome, and filters based on parent category and Years. Now, create a pivot-chart line graph that visualizes this new table.

new sheet4 Create a new sheet with 8 columns Using the COUNTIFS() formula, count how many successful, failed, and canceled projects were created with goals within the ranges listed above. Populate the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns with these data points.  Add up each of the values in the Number Successful, Number Failed, and Number Canceled columns to populate the Total Projects column. Then, using a mathematical formula, find the percentage of projects that were successful, failed, or canceled per goal range.
Create a line chart that graphs the relationship between a goal amount and its chances of success, failure, or cancellation.

Sheet5 new worksheet in your workbook, and create one column for the number of backers of successful campaigns and one column for unsuccessful campaigns.
Use Excel to evaluate the following values for successful campaigns, and then do the same for unsuccessful campaigns:
The mean number of backers
The median number of backers
The minimum number of backers
The maximum number of backers
The variance of the number of backers
The standard deviation of the number of backers
Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
